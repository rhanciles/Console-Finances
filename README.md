_Analyze the financial records of a company._

## Overview
I have in my possession the dataset of a company comprising dates and the Profit/Losses over a period. This is laid out in arrays made up of two fields in the form of a ‘String’ and a ‘Number’. My task is to write JavaScript code that analyses the performance of this company based on these records which you can access here.

## Description
The analytical data I’m expected to bring out is as follows:
  1.	The total number of months included in the dataset.
  2.	The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  3.	The average change in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  4.	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
  5.	The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period. 

## Usage
This Repo is made up of the core files and folders related to the task. I have added comments to all the relevant sections of the code, highlighting key areas and the expected result derived from it. The content comprise only that related to the task and the web page is blank because that results are logged unto a console. This can only be seen by clicking inspect on a Google Chrome or compatible browser and selecting the console tab. Click here to check it out.

## Feedback
Please feel free to reach out or drop a comment here if you have any questions, queries or suggestions. Otherwise, you can find me on the Slack platform Pod 5, just search for Rod.
